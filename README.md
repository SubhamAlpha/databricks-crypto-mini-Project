# databricks-crypto-mini-Project
This project implements a complete End-to-End (E2E) Data Engineering pipeline using the CoinGecko API and Databricks. As a Senior Engineer with 12 years of experience, I designed this system to demonstrate modern data lakehouse principles, focusing on scalability, schema enforcement, and modular design.
